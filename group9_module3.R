#Using the log-transformed data, construct two simple linear models that assess the effect of perch diameter and height by including these as covariates in your models. Be sure to use + notation rather than *, assuming there is no interaction (there isnâ€™t, trust me!).

#Explore how both perch diameter and height effect the hindlimb-SVL relationship by plotting the residuals of your simple linear models against these discrete factors. This will require mutating a data tibble to include residuals from both models. Please produce two separate plots.

#A PGLS model with the hinglimb~SVL relationship + no other covariates

Anole.BM1 <- gls(HTotal ~SVL, correlation = corBrownian(1,phy = anole.tree,form=~Species),data = anole.log, method = "ML")

#Assess the fit of each of these three models using AICc and AICw and comment on (with comments in the script) whether one or both of the covariates is a significant predictor of hindlimb length in a phylogenetic context.

anole.phylo.aic <- AICc(Anole.BM1,Anole.BM2,Anole.BM3,Anole.BM4)
aicw(anole.phylo.aic$AICc)

#Answer:The Model with perch diameter as a covariate has a significantly lower AIC score than the model without covariates, indicating that perch diameter is a significant predictor of hindlimb length in a phylogenetic context. The model with perch height as a covariate has a lower AIC score than the model without covariates indicating that perch height also strengthens the model. The best model (with the lowest AIC score),counts perch height and diameter as covariates. 

#Produce a plot of your own design that concisely visualizes the effect of your covariate(s) and factors (i.e., ecomorph) on the hindlimb residuals of the best fitting PGLS model.
